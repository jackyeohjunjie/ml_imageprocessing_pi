# Real Time Machine learning + Image processing to diagnose crop health
This setup runs a on a hardware setup of a Raspberry Pi and PiCam. When python script is execited app starts up and snaps a picture, image is sent through a custom trained image classifer to first identify the type of crop in the image. After that, image is processed using the openCV library. Result is a diagnosed crop in regards to the crop size, diseased area and percentage value to correlation of golden sample of crop.
